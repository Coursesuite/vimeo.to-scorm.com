# PDF to SCORM

This is the source code to https://pdf.to-scorm.com, a tool for the simple packaging of PDF files in a SCORM wrapper.

There is no server side code. No NPM modules. No massive javascript frameworks.

The heavy lifting is done by https://github.com/Stuk/jszip and https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js
